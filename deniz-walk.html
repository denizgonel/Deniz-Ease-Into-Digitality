            <span class="underline">Date: February 8, 2024</span>
            <span class="underline">Location: New York City</span>
            <span class="underline">Starting Time: 10:00 AM</span>
            <span class="underline">Ending Time: 12:00 PM</span>

            Today, I embarked on a leisurely walk through the bustling streets of <span class="bold">New York City</span>, starting at the corner of <span class="large">5th Avenue</span> and <span class="large">42nd Street</span>.

            As I walked, my attention was captured by an array of colorful posters and flyers adorning the walls and poles along the sidewalk. 
            Busy city streets could be heard with car horns and chatter of pedestrians.

            My curiosity was sparked. I was amused by the quirky invitations and challenges. I felt a newfound appreciation for the human connections fostered by the flyers.

            One flyer caught my eye with its bold proclamation: 
            "Want to try something new?" 
            
            "<span class="large bold">Call Jordon Lee!</span>." 
            The simplicity of the message intrigued me, sparking my curiosity about what <span class="bold">Jordon Lee</span> had to offer. 
            I made a mental note to jot down the number and inquire further later.

            Further down the street, another flyer drew my attention with its playful challenge: 
            <span class="large bold">Chewbacca Roar Contest</span>: Call <span class="large">646-581-9363</span> and leave a voicemail with your best impression. 
            <span class="italic">REWARD $50</span>." 
            
            The absurdity of the invitation brought a smile to my face, and I couldn't help but imagine the cacophony of Chewbacca impersonations echoing through the city.

            Continuing my stroll, I encountered more flyers offering <span class="bold">a diverse range of experiences:</span> 
                            from language exchange meetups 
                                    to amateur photography classes 
                                            and even a knitting circle for beginners.

            Another one caught my eye:

            At last, I arrived at my destination. 
            I approached <span class="bold">Grand Central Station</span> with its towering ceilings and bustling crowds.
            I asked one of the officers for the lost and found room. I stumbled upon the Lost and Found office nestled within its grand halls, looking for my red bag.
